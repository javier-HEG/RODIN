test on py 3.x

build py extension on windows

is there a unit test that also covers extended langs?

add test case for binary data, empty string, etc.

hmm why only null generated ./encodings/compact_lang_det/generated/compact_lang_det_generated_cjkbis_0.cc?  others have null (_0) and non-null versions?

make thread stress test

remove dead files

memory leak...?

am i sure no unicode normalization was done...?  what about NFC normalization for the UChar* API (in cld_unicodetext.cc)?

return list of all detectable langs
